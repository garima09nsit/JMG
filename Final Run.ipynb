    "## Bond Valuation - Pricing Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond is valued as how investors perceives to obtain a certain yield.  Hence, the price of a bond is simply the net present value of all future cash flows discounted back to today based on an internal rate of return called _yield to maturity_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bond that pays annual coupon:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PV = \\frac{C}{(1 + r)^1} + \\frac{C}{(1 + r)^2} + ... + \\frac{C + P}{(1 + r)^n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "$C$ = coupon, \n",
    "$P$ = principal,\n",
    "$r$ = yield to maturity,\n",
    "$n$ = number of periods\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate $PV$ for a bond with semi-annual coupon (coupon frequency = 2), several adjustments must be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $C$ is divided by 2 \n",
    "* $r$ is divided by 2\n",
    "* $n$ is multiplied by 2 (so we have twice the number of terms than an annual coupon bond)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\frac{1}{(1 + r)^t}$ term in the above formula is called _discount factor_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enhance the function `payment_schedule(bond::Bond, as_of_date::Date, yield::Float64)` to accept yield as a new argument.  Now, it must return the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `date`: date of the cash flow\n",
    "  - `amount`: coupon payment, or coupon+principal for the last payment\n",
    "  - `days`: number of days between the as of date and the payment date\n",
    "  - (new) `discount_factor`: discount factor for the period\n",
    "  - (new) `value`: present value of the cash flow, which is simply amount multipled by discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a new function `price(bond::Bond, as_of_date::Date, yield::Float64)` that returns the price of the bond, as calculated below. You can assume par amount of \\\\$1,000 and round the result to 8 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Price = \\frac{PV}{ParAmount} * 100\n",

    "@show price(bond, as_of_date, 0.02875)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We had a problem in yesterday's implementation.  The formula assumes that the valuation date falls on a coupon date (or the issue date) because we discount the cash flows using full periods (1, 2, ..., $n$).  In practice, the valuation date is likely sometime in between coupon dates.\n",
    "\n",
